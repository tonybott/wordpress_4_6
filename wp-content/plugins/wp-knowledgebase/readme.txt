Simple and flexible knowledgebase plugin for WordPress

== Description ==

Create an attractive and professional knowledgebase. It's easy to use, easy to customise, and works with any theme.

= Key Features =

* Simple and easy to use
* Fully RESPONSIVE
* Customise your catalogue presentation easily (choose theme colour, sidebar layouts, number of articles to show etc)
* Super fast search, with predictive text - handy!
* A selection of sidebar widgets (search, categories, tags, posts)
* Integrated breacrumb (on/off)
* Display comments on knowledgebase articles (on/off)
* Drag & Drop for custom ordering of articles and categories
* Works across all major browsers and devices - IE8+, Safari, Firefox, Chrome
* Editable slug (default is /knowledgebase )

= Important =

On activation, the plugin will create a page called "Knowledgebase" and on that page there will be the shortcode `[kbe_knowledgebase]`. If you want to change the slug of that page do so via the WP Knowledgebase settings.

= Advanced Customisation =

Developers, you can completely customise the way the WP Knowledgebase displays by copying the plugin templates to your theme and customising them there. You may be familiar with this method of templating as used by WooCommerce.

In the plugin's root directory you will find a folder called `template`. You can override that folder and any of the files within, by copying them into your active theme and renaming the folder to `/yourtheme/wp_knowledgebase`. WP Knowledgebase plugin will automatically load any template files you have in that folder in your theme, and use them instead of its default template files. If no such folder or files exist in your theme, it will use the ones from the plugin.

This is the safest way to customise the WP Knowledebase templates, as it means that your changes will not be overwritten when the plugin updates.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm getting a 404 error =

Please go to Settings > Permalinks and resave your permalink structure.

= Can I add the search bar to my theme template manually? =

Yes, use this php snippet `<?php kbe_search_form(); ?>`

= Can users vote on articles? Like a thumbs up/down thing? =

This feature is not built into the plugin, however you can use another plugin to achieve this easily. I recommend [WTI Like Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wti-like-post/)

= How can I customise the design? =

You can do some basic presentation adjustments via Knowledgebase > Settings.

= It does not look good on my theme =

Please check that the shortcode `[kbe_knowledgebase]` is added on the Knowledgebase main page.  You can tweak the design using CSS in your theme. Or for more advanced customisation see previous point.

= Can I control privacy or content restrictions for WP Knowledgebase categories and posts? =

Yes. Any content restriction solution that is compatible with Custom Post Types should work with WP Knowledgebase.

= Can I use WP Knowledgebase in my Language? =

Yes, the plugin is internationalized and ready for translation. If you would like to help with a translation please [contact me](http://www.enigmaweb.com.au/contact)
You can also use it WPML. After installing and activating both plugins, go to WPML > Translation Management > Multilangual Content Setup > scroll all the way down > tick the checkbox 'custom posts' and 'custom taxanomies' for this post type, set to 'Translate'.

= Can import/export WP Knowledgebase data? =

Yes. You can import/export data using the built in WordPress function via Tools. It may not import any images in use (although it will import the file paths) so you will need to copy across any images from your old site to the new site uploads folder via FTP. If images still appear broken or missing then you might need to run a search and replace tool to correct the image filepaths for your new site.

= Where can I get support for this plugin? =

If you've tried all the obvious stuff and it's still not working please request support via the forum.
